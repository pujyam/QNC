//Copyright: Intended to be open-source. *Please* be sure to acknowledge author if you use this code
//Purpose:
//  Decompose any given Unitary matrix operator into an OPENQASM netlist of simple physical q-gates
//Date: 20 Nov, 2017
/*
 * POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS FOR FUTURE:
 * (1) One can reduce the gate complexity (upto a constant factor, which may matter for low coherence times and/or large netlists) at the expense of using ancilliary (work) qubits as an alternative to the successive sqrt-gate recursions to reduce control-signals per gate to 1
 * (2) Current code can sometimes generate netlists of O(n*4^n) gate complexity when given Unitary Operators; here, n := #qubits. Gray encoding is already being employed in the Givens decomposition stage, which means we can always achieve O(4^n) in the general case with some more optimization effort on the control-bit masks
 * (3) For approximate computation with bounded errors, we may truncate the successive sqrt recursion to smaller depths. In general, one could use slightly more sophisticated methods, including truncating infinitesimally precise gates from the netlist with little loss in fidelity of final measurements. A very rudimentary truncation is already performed by this compiler
 * (4) Logical qubit placement on physical qubit locations can be optimized automatically, based on machine's qubit connection topology
 * (5) Qubit routing generates gate network using 6n + O(1) time-slots. Mirroring and pipelining can reduce this to 2n + O(1) time-slots
