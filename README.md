# QNC
Quantum Netlist Compiler

## Abstract
Compile unitary operator algorithms and initial state preparations for quantum computers into an OpenQASM-2.0 based quatum gate-level netlist that can then be run directly on the IBM QISKit compatible simulators or IBM's open-access quantum computers. You can even specify the machine's qubit connection topology to produce custom tailored QASM code for each physical machine.
