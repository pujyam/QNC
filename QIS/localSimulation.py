# Purpose: Compile a Quantum Computer Algorithm (as a unitary operator) into a QASM code that can run directly
# on IBM-QX physical machines or QISKit simulator.
# LACC#: LANL LACC# C18030 - QNC: Quantum Netlist Compiler

#Usage:
#  ./localSimulation.py ../Scripts/BV/out.qasm 64
#
import qiskit, sys
print(qiskit.simulators.local_backends())

# use QISKit.org
from qiskit import QuantumProgram

# useful additional packages
from qiskit.tools.visualization import plot_histogram

# Define the QProgram and the Quantum and Classical Registers
qp = QuantumProgram()

qp.load_qasm_file(sys.argv[1], name='experiment')

# Execute the circuit using local QASM simulator
result = qp.execute(["experiment"], backend='local_qasm_simulator', shots=((len(sys.argv) > 2) and int(sys.argv[2]) or 32))
print(result)
print(result.get_counts("experiment"))
# Plot result
plot_histogram(result.get_counts("experiment"))

## Execute the circuit using remote QASM simulator/machine
## Set your API Token
## You can get it from https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/account,
## looking for "Personal Access Token" section.
#QX_TOKEN = "" #TODO: Add your IBM web token here
#QX_URL = "https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/api"
#qp.set_api(QX_TOKEN, QX_URL)
#result = qp.execute(["experiment"], backend='ibmqx4', shots=1024)
#print(result)
#print(result.get_counts("experiment"))
## Plot result
#plot_histogram(result.get_counts("experiment"))
